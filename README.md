# Multithreaded-JavaScript

All exercises that I did in [Multithreaded JavaScript](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/multithreaded-javascript/9781098104429/)


With this book I did not only learn about truly parallelism with JS in the browser, but also learned about concepts and patterns in concurrent programing.
